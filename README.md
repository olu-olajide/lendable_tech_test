## Project Overview

This project automates the deployment of a Dockerized Nginx web server onto AWS EC2 instances using Terraform. It replaces a manual deployment process involving Apache HTTPD, aiming for increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

## Scenario

Our initial website setup on EC2 with Apache HTTPD required manual source updates and configurationsâ€”a time-consuming process. Seeking improvements, we transitioned to a Dockerized environment with Nginx.

## Problem Statement

Transitioning to Docker with Nginx, we encountered issues where containers exited unexpectedly, preventing the web server from staying up and serving the website content.

## Solution

### Step 1: Verify Nginx Configuration

Ensured the Nginx configuration was correct to serve our website content from the `/www` directory within the Docker container.

### Step 2: Examine and Update the Dockerfile

Adjusted the Dockerfile with the necessary changes for user permissions, correct ENTRYPOINT syntax, and included the website content within the Docker image.

### Step 3: Building and Running the Docker Container

Built the Docker image and ran it without volume mounting to simplify debugging, ensuring the website was correctly served.

### Step 4: Automate Deployment with Terraform

Developed Terraform scripts to provision EC2 instances and manage the deployment process across multiple servers. This step involves defining the AWS provider, specifying instance details, security group settings for web traffic, and incorporating user data for automated Docker setup and application deployment.

## CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Our project leverages GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, automating the build and push of our Docker image to Docker Hub, and configuring AWS credentials for deployment. The process ensures every change to the main branch triggers the pipeline, keeping our deployment updated.

### Steps in the CI/CD Pipeline:

- **Checkout**: Clones the repository to the runner.
- **Docker Hub Login**: Logs into Docker Hub using secrets stored in GitHub.
- **Build and Push Docker Image**: Builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub, tagged with the commit SHA and as 'latest'.
- **Configure AWS Credentials**: Configures AWS credentials for deploying the Docker image to the AWS infrastructure.

## Documentation and Commentary

Throughout the project, we maintained detailed documentation and rationale for each decision, highlighting the importance of understanding the process as well as the outcomes.

## Findings and Recommendations

### Performance Optimization

- Employed multi-stage Docker builds and optimized Nginx configurations for better performance.

### Security Enhancements

- Implemented HTTPS in Nginx, restricted SSH access, and utilized AWS IAM roles and policies for enhanced security.

### Cost Management

- Explored auto-scaling and AWS Reserved/Spot Instances for cost-effective resource management.

### Scalability

- Suggested Elastic Load Balancers, Auto Scaling Groups, and container orchestration for scalability.

## Future Work

### Monitoring and Logging

- Planning to set up CloudWatch for monitoring and establish centralized logging for improved diagnostics.

## Quick Start

To quickly start with this project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olu-olajide/lendable_tech_test.git
    cd yourproject
    terraform init
    terraform apply
